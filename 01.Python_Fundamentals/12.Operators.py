# Assignment Operator

a = 20
a += 5
print(a)

# += adds the L.H.S value

print()

"""
Similarly, we have

-= : Substraction
*= : Multiplication
/= : Division

# = is also a assignment operator

"""

# Comparison Operators

print (a == 25)

# Compares the equality R.H.S. and L.H.S. value

print (a != 25)

# Compares the non - equality of R.H.S. and L.H.S.

"""
Similarly, we have
