# Input

Inp = input()
print(Inp)
print()

# Input() takes input from the user in string format

# To use it as Integer we can use int()

IntInp = int(input())
print(IntInp)
print()

# But then it will only accept integer value not string

inpu = input("Entre Your Name : ")

# You can also write a print statement inside input which will work same as print command

# But input only takes 1 argument
